    <h1>POEM:The Eagle</h1>
    <p1>
        He clasps the crag with crooked hands;<br>
        Close to the sun in lonely lands,<br>
        Ring’d with the azure world, he stands.<br>
        The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;<br>
        He watches from his mountain walls,<br>
        And like a thunderbolt he falls.
    </p1><br>
