         <H2>HTML</H2>
        HTML is the basic structure of any webpage.<BR>
        It organizes content using tags like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.<BR>
        Browsers read HTML to display information in order.<BR>
        It tells what each part of the page is, not how it looks.<BR>
        Without HTML, a webpage would have no structure at all.

        <H2>CSS</H2>
        CSS controls the look and design of a webpage.<BR>
        It adds colors, spacing, fonts, layouts, and animations.<BR>
        CSS separates design from structure, keeping code cleaner.<BR>
        It helps make pages responsive across different screen sizes.<BR>
        With CSS, a plain HTML page becomes visually attractive.

        <H2>JAVA SCRIPT</H2>
        JavaScript makes webpages interactive and dynamic.<BR>
        It can respond to clicks, forms, animations, and real-time updates.<BR>
        JavaScript can change HTML and CSS while the page is running.<BR>
        It’s used to build everything from simple effects to full web apps.<BR>
        Without JavaScript, websites would feel static and less engaging.
